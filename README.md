# PFE
📄 Overview:

This project analyzes three major classes of attacks on AI systems — adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model extraction — with a practical focus on adversarial attacks such as FGSM, BIM, PGD, and C&W.
We evaluate multiple defense strategies including Adversarial Training, Defensive Distillation, Random Noise Injection, Adversarial Example Detection, and a hybrid defense approach.
Experiments are performed on two healthcare datasets:

 Breast Cancer Wisconsin (WDBC) with MLP
 COVID-19 Radiography with CNN

⚙️ Installation:
All required dependencies are already installed directly inside the notebooks.  
No additional installation steps are needed.

🚀 How to Run:
You can run the notebooks in any Python environment.  
They were originally executed in Google Colab, but they also work locally.

🗂️ Datasets:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (WDBC)
COVID-19 Radiography
